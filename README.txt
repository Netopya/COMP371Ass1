Arrow keys to rotate the model around the global axes.
Mouse buttons to zoom in and out.
P, W, and T to toggle between Points, Wireframe, and Triangle view

Movement Speed:
In testing, interaction with the program has different sensitivities on different machines.
To modify the rate of rotation and zoom, change the rotatationSpeed and zoomSpeed constants on lines 76 and 77.

Input file:
Please place any input files in the same directory as the main.cpp file as this is the root directory.
